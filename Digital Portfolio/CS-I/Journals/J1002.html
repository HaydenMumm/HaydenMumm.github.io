    I received Asisstance from: My mother and Rohit<br>
    I assisted: no one<br>
    1.1 Two services I can think of that use a client server model are the world wide web and email. <br>
    2.1 I think this is important, because it lets everyone have whatever directory name they want, no matter who has used the name. I also think this\
    ability is very important, because some projects have to have very specific ile naes, so it lets these people ha\
    ve the same specific file names<br>
    3.1 Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it? I feel the new directory has a special symbol to represent it, becau\
    se it lets the user know whether or not the directory is new. <br>
    4.1 Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?
    The prompt did change. This is useful, because it shows you what directory you are in. <br>
    5.1 What happens each time you press the ↑?
    What happens each time you press the ↓? Both of these either show you your newest command or oldest command.
    6.1 Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text? It was printed to the text, beca\
    use it was echoed. <br>
    7.1 How does the ls command differ from the tree command? The LS command is different, because it only shows what is inside the directory. <br>
    7.2 How do you choose to use one over the other?
    By typing in "tree" or "ls" <br>
    8.1 What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?
    For a certain argument to not function for a period of time. <br>
    8.2 I am, because the sleep argument does what I thought it would. <br>
    9.1 How is the behavior different from what you expected?
    The behavior is different from what I expected, because the command did not function as I anticipated. <br>
    9.2 What do you think it means to run a job in the background?
    I think running a job in the background means to not run it on the main screen, instead running it in the background.
    9.3 What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?
    I am not certain on what the number in the background specifies. <br>
    10.1 What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?
    I observe that all of my current jobs pop up.
    10.2 How do you explain your observations?
    I feel that all the jobs showing up are the jobs that I am currently running.
    What did I learn? What is the "big idea"? I feel the big idea of this lesson was to teach us the main ideas of just how important it is to underst\
    and the backbones of the Tabby, so down the line we can really understand how to use the service correctly.
    What challenges did I encounter? One of the main challenges I encountered was understanding exactly what everything meant. Some of these commands \
    and abilities of Tabby were basic and simple, but others were slightly harder to understand.
    How could this experience be improved? I don't feel this experience could be improved much. I feel that this was a great tutorial for a beginner l\
    ike me to understand how to use Tabby and overall helped me learn how to use Coder merlin as well.
    Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking? I feel that what I have learned has affected my thinking, because it helped me fe\
    el that I will be able to understand the concepts of this class, and do better than I originaly thought I would.\
    At first, I fealt that this class was going to be my hardest class of the year, and I would have a lot of studying and a lot of sleepless nights. \
    However, I learned how to go through Coder merlin and Tabby, helping me feel better about everything.
    Free Reflection: Learning about Tabby helped me understand how to use the software. t first I was not quite sure how to use the software, however \
    by the ened I was able to fully understand how to navigate Tabby.
