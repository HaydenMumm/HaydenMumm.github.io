      I received assistance from: my mother<br>
      I Assisted: Nobody<br>
      1.1: Git is communicating to me the commit information (date time etc.) and the comment that I made.<br>
      1.2 Both of them include the comment that I made<br>
      1.3 This helps you remember the comment that you made.<br>
      2.1 They are both red, one is marked modified.<br>
      2.2 They are both displayed in different sections because they have different statusâ€™.<br>
      3.1 They are both displayed as green, the file 1.txt is displayed as modified while the file2.txt is displayed as a new file.<br>
      3.2 The file 2 is displayed as a
      new file, because this was the first time it was added.<br>
      4.1 2 files are displayed as being changed.<br>
      4.2 The color difference is the added text is in green. Some of the specific differences within the files are that the index numbers are different\
      , and that I typed different words.<br>
      5.1 None of the files have changed, because the files have been committed.<br></p>
